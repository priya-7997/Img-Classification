# Img-Classification
This project involves building and implementing a machine learning model to classify images into predefined categories. It showcases the application of machine learning techniques in image processing, feature extraction, and predictive modeling.

## Key Features

- **Dual Model Support**:
  - **MobileNetV2 (ImageNet)**: Recognizes 1,000 different classes from the ImageNet dataset, including everyday objects, animals, and vehicles.
  - **Custom CIFAR-10 Model**: Specializes in classifying images into one of ten specific categories such as airplanes, automobiles, and birds.

- **Intuitive Interface**:
  - **Navigation Bar**: Seamlessly switch between MobileNetV2 and CIFAR-10 models using a sleek sidebar menu.
  - **Real-Time Classification**: Upload an image to receive immediate predictions with confidence scores.
